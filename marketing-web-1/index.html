            <h1>Want to Organize a Potluck?</h1>
            <p>Potlucks are always a great, inexpensive way to bring people together. They take the pressure off one person having to do everything and allow everyone to contribute their favorite dishes with friends, family or co-workers.</p>
            <p>And while potlucks take the pressure off a single party planner, they still require some coordination to make them a success.  After all, who wants to attend  a party where there are 20 different versions of green beans?  </p>
            <p>Using this site/app will make the organization of your next potluck a breeze! By having party-goers RSVP and sign up for what they will bring online, you no longer have to worry about having too much broccoli and not enough chocolate! </p>
